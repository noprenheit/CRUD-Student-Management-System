Create a Student :
It is the first page. Users can provide needed information about a student, and then directly save it to the database. We provided text holders for example inputs. 'Add Student' button below, saves the data to 'Students' collection on the database. This is essential for further testing, although we have some students on the database.
Note: We are using a function that automatically calculates grades from scores. There is no need to type any grade input.

Add a Student to a Class:
It is a button that appears down on the 'Create a Student' page. When users click it, a new page opens, and users can see a search bar for student names. So basically, it is just a faster method for providing samples. When a student is added to the database using 'create a student' method, users can open 'add a student to a class' page, and then search for the student's name, click the select button that appears, and then users can add that selected student to different classes without typing his/her first name, last name, dob.

Delete a Student:
It is the second page. It has the purpose of deleting a student from a class. Open the page, search for a student, and click the select button. A 'selected student ID' appears. Below that, users can see the different classes of selected the student, and simply selecting a class, then 'delete class' button does what it has to do.

Read a Student:
This is the third and main page for an overview of what we have on the database. We chose to use contrasting colors for better visibility. There is a clickable dropdown menu saying 'Show Chart'. Then users can select a class, then they can see the distribution of grades of the selected class. Users can navigate between classes, so it is a fast and easy method of looking grade charts of each class. It is possible to toggle charts using the 'hide chart' option.

Update a Student:
This is the fourth and last page. It updates selected students selected class's grades. Open the page, search for a student, click the name of the student, select a class to update from the list, type new score, and click the 'update' button. Pretty straightforward.
