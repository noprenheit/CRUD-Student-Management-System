# CRUD App for Student Management System

## Features

### Creating a Student
On the first page, users can easily fill in the necessary details to create a new student profile. With sample text as a guide, users can quickly enter information and hit the **'Add Student'** button to save everything directly to the database. The system automatically calculates the student's grade based on their scores, so there’s no need to input grades manually.

### Adding a Student to a Class
Once a student has been created, assigning them to classes is seamless. At the bottom of the 'Create a Student' page, users will find a button that takes them to a page with a search bar. Users can search for the student by name, select the student, and add them to any class without having to re-enter details like their name or date of birth. This makes the process fast and hassle-free.

### Deleting a Student
To remove a student from a class, navigate to the second page. Here, users can search for the student, select their ID, and see all the classes they’re part of. From there, simply select the relevant class and click the **'Delete Class'** button to remove them from that specific class.

### Viewing a Student’s Data
The third page offers an overview of the student data in the database, with easy-to-read visuals. Users can use the **'Show Chart'** dropdown menu to select a class and view a grade distribution chart. This feature allows users to quickly toggle between classes for a fast and effective way to analyze performance. There’s also a **'Hide Chart'** option to turn off the chart if it’s not needed.

### Updating a Student's Grades
On the last page, users can update a student’s grades with just a few clicks. After searching for the student and selecting their name, users can choose a class from the list, enter the new score, and click the **'Update'** button to save the changes. The process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.
